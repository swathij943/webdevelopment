# WebDevelopment

Webdevelopment means building websites for internet. The concept is that there is a client/browser(frontend) make request a server(backend), and the server replies back to the client request in the form of code. It means its a process of request and response cycle. The best example is we are going to a hotel and we select our menu and make our request for what all things we want and the attenders transfer this request to kitchen. Kitchen then makes those dishes and provides the food to customers, so the basic thing is customers here acts as frontend/client, kitchen acts as server, attenders acts as api's that transfer these request and response between the client and server.

In frontend webdevelopment the things that we need are HTML - Structure/Skeleton, CSS - Styles/External features, JavaScript - Functionality/Movement. For eg consider human body HTML acts as Skeleton, CSS acts as Features/styles & JavaScript acts as movement.


## HTML(HyperTextMarkupLanguage)

### Its helps for structure & formatting. The HTML Element that browser recognize are a. Paragraph - <p></p> b. Heading - <h1></h1>


### HTML Tags - A container for some content or other tags

### Tags are of different types paragarph <p></P> tag, bold <b></b> tag, heading <h1></h1> tag, nesting tags etc...

1. Heading Elements

### <h1></h1> -- it has big heading size <h2></h2> -- it has medium heading size <h3></h3> -- it has small heading size <h4></h4> -- it is very small heading size <h5></h5> -- it is even smaller heading size <h6></h6> -- it is the smallest heading size

2. HTML Boilerplate

### Standard format or Skeleton of writing HTML code
<!-- 
<!DOCUMENTTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en"> --- it the root
  <head>         --- it stores meta data
   <title>My First Page</title>
   </head>
   <body>       --- its the display part on browser
    <p>Hello World!</p>
    </body>
</html>
 -->

3. List in HTML

They are of 2 types

### Ordered list (ol): The numbers will be automatically assigned by the browser to each item in a ordered list. Ordered list: <ol><li></li></ol>


eg: 
<!--
 <ol>
 <li>Item 1</li>
 <li>Item 2</li>
 <li>Item 3</li>
</ol> 
 -->

### Unordered list (ul): its not ordered Unordered list: <ul><li></li></ul>

eg:
<!-- 
<ul>
 <li>Item 1</li>
 <li>Item 2</li>
 <li>Item 3</li>
</ul> 
 -->

4. HTML Attributes
HTML attributes provide additional information about an element and can be added to all elements in HTML, including tags for images, links, paragraphs, head

eg: type, img, href etc..

5. Anchor Element
### The anchor element aka "link" creates hyperlinks to other web pages. The most common use for this element is to link from one page <a href="link">Title</a>
